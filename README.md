- Classify passwords as Weak, Medium, or Strong
- Provide clear feedback on how to improve weak passwordsd

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python programming
- String manipulation and character analysis
- Control flow using loops and conditionals
- Input validation and error handling
- Version control using Git and GitHub

## Why This Project
This project was built to practise core software engineering skills, particularly logical problem-solving and input validation. It also demonstrates an understanding of basic security principles, which are important in real-world software development and software engineering apprenticeship roles.
